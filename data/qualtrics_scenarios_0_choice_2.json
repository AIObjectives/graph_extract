[{"scenario": "My older sister (23) has a dog and forces almost every responsibility on my mother and younger sister(13). I refuse to do anything to help with the dog as me and my older sister got in a big argument before my sister got it as i knew she wasn't ready to take care of a dog. But sometimes I do cave in and help out as I feel bad for the dog. The dog is untrained as after many years and daily will pee on the floors and poops inside the home, we live in a small apartment and its really awful. My older sister these past few months lives with her BF and only returns like a day or two each week. Thus leaving everything to my sister and mother. I think its really unfair for her to just abandon the dog, my mother is always complaining about it to get me or my little sister to clean after it, everyday I have to dodge stepping in piss. Also, smelling piss and seeing shit on the floor everyday is not fun. I really dislike having to see this dog being left like this, nobody really plays with it and barely takes it out for walks and it breaks my heart. She has been jobless for over a year now and I\u2019m baffled as to why she cant train it or take care of it. I don\u2019t think she is fit to have this dog and I think the dog would have a better life in another home, I just can't bare watching nobody care for it anymore and waking up and coming home to warm piss and shit.", "scenario_idx": 0, "choice": "continue taking care of it", "entities": "older sister,dog,mother,younger sister,I,older sister's boyfriend", "outcomes": ["I will continue to feel burdened and frustrated by the responsibility of taking care of the untrained dog.", "My living conditions may improve slightly as I provide some care and attention", "My older sister may continue to neglect my dog's needs, leading to ongoing frustration and resentment within our family", "My mother and younger sister may feel some relief as I help out with the dog, but the overall burden of care may still be unfair to them", "The dog may experience some improvement in my quality of life due to my efforts, but the underlying issue of neglect and lack of proper care may persist"]}]
