[{"scenario": "I (24M) have been with my girlfriend(29F) for a little over a year now, and we have been living together for the past ~6 months. She is originally from Taiwan, and is trying to make a life for herself here. I realized a long time ago that I didn't see a future with her. However, I have stayed with her because I just can't imagine breaking up with her, and her having to make a life for herself here with little to no help. I pay for our rent (I have a good job for a 24 y/o, so its not really a financial burden), take her to school, and do the majority of the cooking. I feel like she would have a hard time surviving in America without someone to help her out (mainly financially). Her English is extremely poor, so she has a lot of difficulty talking to people here. I feel really guilty about this situation, because I feel like I am wasting her time. I figured I could stay with her up until the point she can stand on her own two feet here and support herself. She is an extremely kind person, and I want the best for her. I want her to find someone who truly loves her and wants to build a future with her.
