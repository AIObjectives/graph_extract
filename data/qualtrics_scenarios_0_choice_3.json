[{"scenario": "My older sister (23) has a dog and forces almost every responsibility on my mother and younger sister(13). I refuse to do anything to help with the dog as me and my older sister got in a big argument before my sister got it as i knew my sister wasn't ready to take care of a dog. But sometimes I do cave in and help out as I feel bad for the dog. The dog is untrained as after many years and daily will pee on the floors and poops inside the home, we live in a small apartment and its really awful. My older sister these past few months lives with her BF and only returns like a day or two each week. Thus leaving everything to my sister and mother. I think its really unfair for her to just abandon the dog, my mother is always complaining about it to get me or my little sister to clean after it, everyday I have to dodge stepping in piss. Also, smelling piss and seeing shit on the floor everyday is not fun. I really dislike having to see this dog being left like this, nobody really plays with it and barely takes it out for walks and it breaks my heart. She has been jobless for over a year now and I'm baffled as to why my sister cant train it or take care of it. I don't think my sister is fit to have this dog and I think the dog would have a better life in another home, I just can't bare watching nobody care for it anymore and waking up and coming home to warm piss and shit.", "scenario_idx": 0, "choice": "demand that my sister gives the dog up for adoption to a better home.", "entities": "older sister,dog,mother,younger sister,I", "outcomes": ["My sister may feel confronted or defensive about the demand to give up the dog.", "My mother and younger sister might support my decision if they feel overwhelmed by the responsibility.", "The dog could potentially be rehomed to a more suitable environment where it receives proper care and training.", "Tension may increase within the family due to the disagreement over the dog's future.", "I might feel relieved for advocating for the dog's well-being.", "The family's living conditions could improve if the dog is rehomed, eliminating the issues with cleanliness.", "My relationship with my older sister could be strained further due to this confrontation."]}]
