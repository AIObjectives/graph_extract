[{"scenario": "I recently got my 1st job and I was super excited. I've been searching for a few months and I finally got hired by a local store. You know what they say, you should never be late to work, especially if it's your very first day of your very first job. The shop is about a half an hour walk from my house and I had to be there at 7:40 to open and prepare before 8 o'clock. I left my home around 7:10 to be extra sure I would arrive on time. After about 15 minutes I was on this really long uphill road when at the end of it I see someone on a bike going extremely fast. After about 4-5 seconds I heard a loud noise and turned my head around to see that he has crashed after, I imagine, going over a pothole. He must have been about 50 meters away from me by then. But my boss is really strict and upsetting him was the last thing I wanted on my first day.", "scenario_idx": 2, "choice": "stop to help and be late for work", "entities": "I,local store boss,person on bike", "outcomes": ["I will be late for work", "I will receive help from Ziv.", "My boss may be upset about me being late", "The store may not be fully prepared for opening at 8 o'clock", "I may feel a sense of fulfillment for helping someone in need"]}]
