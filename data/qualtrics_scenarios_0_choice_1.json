[{"scenario": "My older sister (23) has a dog and forces almost every responsibility on my mother and younger sister(13). I refuse to do anything to help with the dog as me and my older sister got in a big argument before my sister got it as i knew my sister wasn't ready to take care of a dog. But sometimes I do cave in and help out as I feel bad for the dog. The dog is untrained as after many years and daily will pee on the floors and poops inside the home, we live in a small apartment and its really awful. My older sister these past few months lives with her BF and only returns like a day or two each week. Thus leaving everything to my sister and mother. I think its really unfair for her to just abandon the dog, my mother is always complaining about it to get me or my little sister to clean after it, everyday I have to dodge stepping in piss. Also, smelling piss and seeing shit on the floor everyday is not fun. I really dislike having to see this dog being left like this, nobody really plays with it and barely takes it out for walks and it breaks my heart. She has been jobless for over a year now and I'm baffled as to why my sister cant train it or take care of it. I don't think my sister is fit to have this dog and I think the dog would have a better life in another home, I just can't bare watching nobody care for it anymore and waking up and coming home to warm piss and shit.", "scenario_idx": 0, "choice": "refuse to take care of the dog unless my sister steps up and takes responsibility.", "entities": "I,older sister,dog,mother,younger sister,older sister's BF", "outcomes": ["I may feel angry or resentful towards my older sister for not helping with the dog", "My mother and younger sister may feel overwhelmed and burdened by the additional responsibility of taking care of the untrained dog.", "The untrained dog may continue to suffer from lack of proper care and attention", "The living environment in the small apartment may continue to be unpleasant due to the dog's untrained behavior", "Tension and conflict within the family may increase due to the ongoing issue of the untrained dog", "The dog's well-being and quality of life may not improve unless significant changes are made"]}]
